I am a Masters candidate at the Australian National University and the <a href="https://www.roboticvision.org/">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/robert-mahony">Rob Mahony</a>.
My research involves developing novel deep learning algorithms for applications in robotic vision.
A particular application I have focused on is object position and orientation (pose) estimation of crops for agricultural robotics.
The research areas I have worked in are Robotics, Computer Vision, and Robotic Vision.
I began my candidature in 2019 and expect to submit my thesis in February 2021.

Prior to this I spent a year working as Research Engineer, again with the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision.
In this role I assisted in the development of a robotic harvester for green asparagus crops.
I also assisted in research aimed at developing a novel simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm.

I have also obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree majoring in Mechatronic Engineering and Systems Engineering, and a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Mathematics.
Both from the Australian National University.

Through my education and employment I have gained experience in a range of programming languages, software packages, and operating systems, including:
* Python
* Matlab
* C++
* BASH
* C\#
* Robot Operating System (ROS)
* Ubuntu
* Pytorch
* Altium Designer
* Github
* Amazon Web Service (AWS)

I have also obtained experience in the following concepts:
* Deep learning
* Linear and Non-linear filtering
* Version Control
* Remote Servers
* High Performance Computing
* 3D reconstruction
* Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)
* Camera calibration
* Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design
* Transmission Control/Internet Protocols
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  
**I am currently seeking full-time work and can start at short notice.**
