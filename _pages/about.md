<!-- I am a Masters candidate at the Australian National University and the <a href="https://www.roboticvision.org/">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/robert-mahony">Rob Mahony</a>. -->
<!-- My research involves developing novel deep learning algorithms for applications in robotic vision. -->
<!-- A particular application I have focused on is object position and orientation (pose) estimation of crops for agricultural robotics. -->
<!-- The research areas I have worked in are Robotics, Computer Vision, and Robotic Vision. -->
<!-- I began my candidature in 2019 and expect to submit my thesis in February 2021. -->
<!-- 
Prior to this I spent a year working as Research Engineer, again with the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision.
In this role I assisted in the development of a robotic harvester for green asparagus crops.
I also assisted in research aimed at developing a novel simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. -->

I am a results-driven software engineer with over 4 years of professional experience, specializing in backend development, data management, and high-performance software solutions. Proficient in languages such as C, C++, Python, and Bash, I have a proven track record of delivering scalable and efficient solutions in fast-paced environments. In my current role at Magentus, I am responsible for spearheading critical projects within a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), where I design and implement advanced features for billing and data management. I am also an integral part of the rapid-response team, resolving complex technical issues for global clients. 

I am always eager to take on new challenges, advance my technical skill set, and contribute to the development of cutting-edge software solutions. I am highly self-motivated, with excellent time-management skills, consistently delivering high-quality work while meeting tight deadlines. My ability to work independently, as well as collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, ensures that I contribute meaningfully to the success of any project. 

I have completed a Masters of Philosophy degree at the Australian National University, in which I conducted research in robotics and computer vision.
I have also obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree majoring in Mechatronic Engineering and Systems Engineering, and a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Mathematics.
