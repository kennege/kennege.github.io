During lockdown in 2021 I decided to try and learn some web development, something that I've always wanted to do.
I chose to develop a simple budgeting calculator, something that I hope to get some use out of, even if no one else does!

I developed the site from scratch without any frameworks (mainly because I didn't know any when I started, and I thought it best to start with the basics).

I built the front end first, beginning with the HTML, then the CSS, before moving to JavaScript to add interaction. 
To help make life a bit easier for myself I also played around with JQuery and Bootstrap.

For the backend I used AJAX, PHP and MySQL to build a login system and store budget data. 
The main reason I wanted to add a backend was so that I could track my budget longer term, and not have to re-enter information when I cleared cookies.

The website is live at [abudgetcalculator.com](http://abudgetcalculator.com/), and the code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/kennege/ABudgetCalculator).

For now the site is (sort of) finished (there's always more I could do).
I really enjoyed the process of learning and then writing this site.
